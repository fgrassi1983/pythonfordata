    "A quick recap on what we have seen so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable types\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned about different variable types such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **int**    integers, e.g. 9 .\n",
    "* **float**    numbers with decimals, e.g. 3.14.\n",
    "* **str**    text, e.g. \"hello\".\n",
    "* **list**    ordered containers where every item can be accessed by its index, e.g. mylist = [1, 4, \"bla\"], mylist[1] ---> 4. New items can be added with the .append method, e.g. mylist.append(\"hello\"). \n",
    "* **dict**    unordered containers where every item can be accessed by its name, e.g. mydict = {\"firstname\":\"Robert\", \"height\":175}, mydict[\"userid\"] ---> 123. New items can be added by declaration: mydict[\"weight\"] = 70. \n",
    "* **tuple**    ordered containers like lists, e.g. (1, 4, \"bla\"), but immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**for** loops are used to iterate through any iterable object (e.g. lists, dictionaries, range(x,y)), and to repeat the same block of code at every cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "**while** loops are used to repeat the same block of code as long as the condition specified in the while statement is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "    guessthenumber = 9\n",
    "    \n",
    "    userguess = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while userguess != guessthenumber:\n",
    "        userguess = input(\"Guess\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### if ... elif ... else\n",
    "\n",
    "**if** statements are used to run code only when a given condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**elif** optionally follow after if statements, allowing for handling of multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "    elif x == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is 0\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**else** statements, also optional, may go at the end of an if statement, as a catch all if all previous conditions were false. Note that else statements do not require a condition to be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "    elif x == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is 0\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow us to store a set of instructions which can then be used with the function's name. Functions can take any number of arguments, including zero. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def square(x):\n",
    "        return x * x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    first10squared = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(1,11):\n",
    "        first10squared.append(square(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions are one line functions, which can be both named (i.e. assigned to a name, like variables) or anonymous (e.g. inside list(map()) constructs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Named lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "    square = lambda x: x*x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    first10squared = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(1,11):\n",
    "        isquared = square(i)\n",
    "        first10squared.append(isquared)\n",
    "        \n",
    "Anonymous function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    first10squared = list(map(lambda x: x * x, range(1,11)))\n",
    "\n",
    "### List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are ways to quickly populate a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    first10squared = [x*x for x in range(1,11)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, list comprehensions are faster than the other methods we have seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are code, written and tested by someone else, that can be imported to add functions to our code without having to implement them manually. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",

    "Let us examine the syntax. We called the **merge()** method on the *sales* DataFrame. The first argument we passed it was the DataFrame we wished to join it with, in this case, *customers*. The second argument is **how**, and it can most commonly be *left*, *inner*, or *right*. Do not worry too much about this for now, we will see how these options differ in the next lesson. The last two arguments, *left_on* and *right_on* are used to choose which columns we want to use to match entries from the left (*sales*) and right (*customers*) DataFrames. In this case, we used *userid* from *sales*, and *id* from *customers*, because we want to map our sales data with our customers data using their ids.\n",
