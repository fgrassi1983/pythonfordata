    "\n",
    "### Python 2 vs. 3\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main versions of Python: 2 and 3. This course will focus on Python 3, but unfortunately it is quite likely that you will be using Python 2. We will try to upgrade your version to Python 3, but meanwhile, we can make 2 behave like 3 by using the following command at the beginning of our notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function\n",
    "    \n",
    "The differences between 2 and 3 are small, but significant. You do not need to concern yourself with them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are a modular environment for programming in several different languages (e.g. Python, R). The distinctive feature of Jupyter Notebooks is that it enables users to run isolated blocks of code, instead of having to run a whole script or program from start to finish. This can be extremely useful during data exploration, or if your script is over 1000 lines long and you only wish to test a small section of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can select a cell by clicking on it. When in edit mode, the frame surrounding the cell will be green. If you press **\"esc\"**, the frame will turn blue: you can now navigate to other cells using the arrow keys, and you can create new cells above or below the selected one by pressing **\"a\"** (for \"above\") or **\"b\"** (for \"below\"). Cells can also be removed: this is done by pressing the **\"x\"** button, which is equivalent to \"cut\". **Please note that there is no undo button**: a cut cell can still be pasted by pressing **\"v\"**, but only the last cut cell is kept in memory, so if you cut two cells, the previous one will be unrecoverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can either contain code or text. To switch, you can either press **\"m\"** (for text/Markdown) and **\"y\"** (for code), or you can just click on the drop down menu to the right the \"fast forward\" (>>) symbol and select **\"Code\"** or **\"Markdown\"**. At any time, you can also click on the rightmost button and view a complete list of all available keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run a cell, you can press either **Ctrl + Enter** or **Shift + Enter**. The only difference is that Shift + Enter will automatically move you to the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief summary table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command  | Result  |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "| a  | Create new cell (above) |\n",
