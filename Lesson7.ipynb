    "Today, we begin to examine some basic concepts of machine learning (ML). Broadly speaking, machine learning is a field of study focused on algorithms that can adapt to data to produce a desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main flavors of ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supervised - The algorithm is given a set of data to learn from, and then uses that information to make predictions about new data.\n",
    "* Unsupervised - The algorithm is given a set of unlabelled data and looks for patterns and similarities.\n",
    "* Reinforcement - Learning \"from scratch\" focused on maximizing a desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are going to introduce the basics of supervised machine learning. Supervised machine learning can itself be divided into **regression**, which is focused on predicting the value of a numeric target (e.g. price, weight, area...), and **classification**, which is used to predict a datapoint's **class** (e.g. species, sex, genre...). In our exercise, we will use the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information on passengers of the Titanic, and we are going to attempt to use that information to predict whether individual passengers survived: a **classification** problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<font color =#0000ff>1+1 = 2</font><br>\n",

    "If we were then to test his progress, we would likely ask the boy to calculate a few sums for us. But what sums? If we ask the boy to calculate the ones we just showed him, i.e. <font color =#0000ff>1+1</font>, <font color =#9933bb>2+3</font>, <font color =#006699>7+3</font>, <font color =#669966>10+1</font>, and <font color =#bbbb33>4+15</font>, how will we know that he did not just memorize those results?
