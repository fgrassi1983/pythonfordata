    "Lastly, we performed a Student's T test to compare the means of x vs. y, and x vs. z. We did this by calling the **ttest_ind()** function from the **stats** module which we imported earlier. Unsurprisingly, there was no statistically significant difference between x and y, whereas the difference between x and z was significant.\n",

    "One last word about NumPy: the main variable in NumPy is the array. An array is very similar to a list, but it has been optimized for performance. You do not need to worry too much about that, but for now, suffice to say that you can often treat arrays the same as you would lists, e.g.:"

    "1) Using a list comprehension, create an array (so, np.array([your list comprehension here])) with 10 random integers between -100 and 100, using the np.random.randint() function.\n",

    "2) Use np.mean(), np.median() to get some information about the array you just created. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use another list comprehension to filter out all negative values from your array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Using a list comprehension, create an array with 100 random numbers taken from a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Define a function that calculates the standard deviation, and then use it on the array you just created (remember, the formula is sqrt(sum(x_i - x_mean)**2 / n). You can calculate the sum of the squared residuals with sum() or np.sum(), and the mean of x using the built-in .mean() method, or np.mean(). \n",

    "6) Now use numpy's std() function to verify that your result is correct.\n",
